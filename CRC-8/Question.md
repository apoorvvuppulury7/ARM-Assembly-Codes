# AIM
Write an ARM Assembly program to compute CRC-8.

Use CRC-8 file to understand the concept of cyclic redundancy check (CRC).

Use ARM Code to understand the running on the Keil Uvision 4 softwares.

# Program Details
TASK :- Compute CRC-8 (poly x^8+x^2+x+1) of a data block pointed by R0 with length in R1. Result in R2.
1) Write ARM Assembly Code using registers and instructions to achieve the task. 
2) Instructions to use MOV, ADD, SUB, STR, LDR, CMP, BNE, BEQ, BGT - to implement the logic.
3) Use loops where required.
4) Share results in memory when asked.

HINT :- Follow the algorithm step by step. Verify the results in the memory window/registers in the Keil debugger.
